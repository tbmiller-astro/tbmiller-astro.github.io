## About Me

My name is Tim Miller and I am a PhD student and Gruber Fellow studying Astronomy at Yale University. I'm generally interested in all things related to galaxy formation but my main research topic is galaxy morpology. I mostly work with data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Dragonfly Telephoto array to study galaxy morpology and high and low redshift. My thesis advisor is Pieter van Dokkum.

I grew up in Calgary, Alberta, Canada and received My B.Sc and M.Sc in Physics from Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada before moving to Yale. While I was at Dal I worked with Scott Chapman studying sub-mm galaxies, specifically using them to signpost proto-clusters in the early universe.
