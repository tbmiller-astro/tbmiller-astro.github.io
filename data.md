### Galaxy photomotry in the DWFS
Please find a [link](https://github.com/tbmiller-astro/tbmiller-astro.github.io/blob/main/assets/Miller2020_DWFS_galphot.dat) to a catalog of photometry measurements for massive galaxies in the Dragonfly Wide Field Survey from [Miller et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07310). The photometry is measured by integrating the 1-D profile as described in the paper and is converted to the SDSS filter system. Total magnitudes for the g and r band reported as well as teh g-r color. Please cite the above paper if you use this data and reach out to me if you have any questions.
