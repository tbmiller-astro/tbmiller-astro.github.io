Listed on this page are brief descriptions of many of the research projects I am interested in at the moment. Please click on the links to find more information on any of them


### Thesis projects

#### [Using color gradients to understand galaxy growth](/research/col_grad/)

Galaxies are known to have radial gradients in the colors, indicating complex multi-component formation histories. In my thesis I have studied color gradients in galaxies in the early universe to help understand how they grow.

#### [How to define the size of a galaxy?](/research/gal_size/)

The sizes and structures of different types of galaxies serve as important tools to investigate their formation. However, deciding how to define a galaxy's size and what tracer to use has large implications on ones interpretation. Most of my thesis has focused on better understanding both of these issues.

#### [Moving beyond the Sersic profile](/research/imcascade/)

I am interested in novel data analysis techniques, specifically those focused on measuring galaxy morphology. I developed a new method imcascade, which utilizes a series of Gaussians to be more flexible then traditional Sersic fitters and better represent realistic galaxies.

#### [Dragonfly](/research/dragonfly/)

I am part of the team operating the [Dragonfly telephoto array](https://www.dragonflytelescope.org/); a specialized telescope built to study the low-surface brightness universe. I have focused on studying the outskirts of massive galaxies using Dragonfly.

### Past Work

In the past I have worked on other exciting research projects. In my first year at Yale I studied the [dynamics of sub-halos](/research/self_fric/) using numerical simulations. During my B.Sc and M.Sc, I focused on [sub-mm galaxies](/research/submm/); intensely active and massive galaxies in the early universe.
