Hello, I am a currently CIERA postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern who studies observational galaxy evolution. I grew up in Calgary, Canada and received My B.Sc and M.Sc in Physics from Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada before moving to Yale. While I was at Dal I completed my B.Sc and M.Sc working with Scott Chapman studying sub-mm galaxies. I received my PhD from Yale where my advisor was Pieter van Dokkum

While I am broadly interested in many aspects observational galaxy formation, summed up in one sentence **my main research goal is: Using multiwavelength images to learn about the physical properties of galaxies**. This includes studying the morphology of galaxies in the early Universe using the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes to learn about their formation and developing new methods to infer the distances to nearby dwarf galaxies. Much of this work involves the development of software and novel methods, often including Bayesian inference and Machine learning techniques.
