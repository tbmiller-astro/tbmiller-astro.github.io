Hello, I am a PhD student and Gruber Fellow studying Astronomy at Yale University. My thesis advisor is Pieter van Dokkum. I'm generally interested in all things related to galaxy formation but my main research topic is galaxy morphology. I use Bayesian and Machine learning techniques to learn about galaxy properties from their images. My thesis has focused on developing and applying better, more flexible ways to measure galaxy morphology.

I grew up in Calgary, Canada and received My B.Sc and M.Sc in Physics from Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada before moving to Yale. While I was at Dal I completed my B.Sc and M.Sc working with Scott Chapman studying sub-mm galaxies.
