Hello, I am a CIERA postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern. I just started in the Fall of 2023, before that I complete my PhD from Yale University

I'm generally interested in all things related to observational galaxy formation but my main interested galaxy morphology; studying the evolution of galaxy structure over cosmic time. I am particularly passionate about software and data-science, specifically applying Bayesian methods to astrophysical problems. To learn more about my software or research click the [link here](/research)

I grew up in Calgary, Canada and received My B.Sc and M.Sc in Physics from Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada before moving to Yale. While I was at Dal I completed my B.Sc and M.Sc working with Scott Chapman studying sub-mm galaxies. At Yale my PhD advisor was Pieter van Dokkum
